# To compile from source 

First download the capstone package. WITHOUT THIS THIS WILL NOT FUNCTION. For me in Fedora, it'll be:
```bash
sudo dnf install capstone        # Just running the precompiled binary
sudo dnf install capstone-devel  # Compiling from source
```
But your specific install command may vary, check the documentation for YOUR OS / Distro. 

Then, run in the main project directory:
```bash 
chmod +x ./build.sh
./build.sh
```

This will compile it using CMake and do all the linking for you. 

# Adding to path

If you want to add it to your command line, copy paste this into your .bashrc file (located in ~/)
```bash 
export PATH=$PATH:~/path/to/package
```
You can also just move it to your /usr/bin/. I don't see a downside to this. 
 
## Live Patching

One feature of Scallop Shell is live patching in the byte displays. If you want to change any of the bytes in the display, just click on the byte you want to change. Of course, the only values you can enter are 0-9 and A-F. Once you're done patching the bytes, hit enter and it'll save. You can hit Shift+Z to undo the edits you made UNTIL you step to the next instruction. Upon stepping, the live patcher will send a request to the emulator to modify the memory you changed. This then clears the history, so undoing is no longer possible. You can still edit it again of course.

## Notepad 

You can take notes on the Notepad tab about what you're working on. Ctrl+S to save. When you open Scallop Shell in the same directory again, it'll open your old notes back up.
